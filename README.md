# File Upload

A fully customizable and lightweight multi-file upload component built with React and Next.js. It features a smooth user experience and clean, modern UI â€” ideal for any project that needs reliable and flexible file uploads.

This component was built from scratch to explore UI/UX patterns in file uploading, including edge cases and retry mechanisms â€” all with a focus on user-friendly interactions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
